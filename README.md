This project requires me to make a multi-client server. It is coded in Java. There are more details in the ReadMe.txt file on how it works, along with the commands.

One thing to note is that this project is supposed to have a Coordinator, which is something I didn't have enough time to implement. So I made a command that imitated different servers.
